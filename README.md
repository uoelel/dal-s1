## DAL - Summative 1

**DUE Week 10 - Thu 28 March at noon**

This repository contains the code and data you'll need for completing the first summative assessment for DAL.



## How to download and get started 

1. Click on the green "Code" button above > Download ZIP.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Double-click on `dal-s1.Rproj` to open the RStudio Project.
4. From the "Files" tab in RStudio, open `code/analysis.qmd`. This file contains everything you'll need to complete the assignment.

**Note that this is how you should always be opening your files!**

Opening the project first, rather than the Rmd file, ensures that relative paths to the data will work the way we expect them to.
If you've been having problems with relative paths in the past, then this may be why.


## How to submit

1. Render the Rmd file to HTML.
2. Rename the HTML file to your exam number only.
3. Upload the HTML file to Learn.
